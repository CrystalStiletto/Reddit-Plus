I encourage you to read about the features first, to know what awesomeness you're about experience!

If you feel sure about what you're doing, you can skip ahead to the [installation](#installation) right away and get started with Reddit Plus :-)

##Details
Reddit Plus is a userscript for Reddit that adds additional features to simplify your Reddit life..

###Comments toggle
Open comments in the list view with just 1 click, loading them just underneath the post. In the same way that you can easily expand the description text of a post you can now load the comments.
In this added view, you can vote, write a new comment and reply to any existing comments.

Next to each `comments` link of each post in a list view, you can now find a little `[+]` button, give it a go!

There is still mainly 1 issue with this feature at the moment:
- When voting up a post with the comments opened, it looks as if all comments have been voted on too (vote button turned orange), but that is NOT the case, it's just a visual change, not an actual vote. This is due to the way that Reddit handles voting and I can't do anything about it yet.
